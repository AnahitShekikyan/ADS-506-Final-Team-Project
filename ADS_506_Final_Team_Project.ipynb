        "This time series decomposition plot breaks down the \"cnt\" (count of bike rentals) into three components: \"trend\", \"seasonal\", and \"residual\". This plot suggests that bike rentals have been steadily increasing over time, with noticeable patterns that repeat, likely due to seasons or specific times of the year. However, there are some fluctuations and unexpected variations that can't be fully explained by these patterns, hinting at the influence of random or external factors."

As the lag increases (e.g., moving from 0 to 100, 200, etc.), the autocorrelation drops, meaning that the relationship between the current and past values weakens. The presence of autocorrelation over several lags indicates that past values of bike rentals are informative for predicting future values, and it may suggest the need for further differencing or the inclusion of autoregressive terms in a forecasting model.\n",
